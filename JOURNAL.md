# 28 June 2025 - Project Kick-off (3 Hours)
- Drafted project goals and some technical details
- Flashed Raspberry Pi 3 for testing
- Sucsessfully got display to connect
- Got flutter set up and demo working
- Set up dev enviroment on macbook
- Started (re)Learning Flutter Basics
- Started thinking about the layout of the UI
# 29 June 2025 - Components Research (1 hour)
I was researching different types of displays, but ended up deciding upon a standard raspberry pi display after much concideration for a nice AMOLED screen, it's just too expensive. I'll make a BOM soon!
# 29 June 2025 - Design sketch (30 mins)
- Just sketched a design and wrote about Solace and LifeLog.

# 30 June 2025 - Design Prototype Case (3 hours)
Today I designed two iterations of the case all while rembering how to use Fusion 360, just a very early testing stage with some broken screen (honestly might be a safty hazard if it wasn't hidden by the case) and stuff I've got laying around. I plan to redesign it to fit what ever display I end up choosing. On that note, I've got almost all of the components picked out except the display... I know, I started concidering the OLED screens again.

# 1 July 2025 - UI Implementation (1 hour)
- Today I was limited on time, but I tested different fonts, spacing, and colors. I also added some nice color gradents depending on what time of day it is. Tomorrow I plan to add pages to the UI, and hook it into the LifeLog API!

# 1 July into 2 July - Picking Parts, CAD, and Research (past mid-might, 4 hours)
I stayed up until at least 1am doing this. I'm tired.
- I realized I knew very little about the audio world, but through research I figured out that your enclosure size maters when picking a speaker. As a result of this I had to ensure that it would still sound good in my case. I've decided on the PLS-P830985 as it's budget friendly and small enough to fit inside my project. I found a better alternitive, but it was $100, out of my budget.
- On the cad design, I fixed some minor issues like some misalignments.
- Made progress on the BOM!
# 2 July - Finalizing BOM and Research (3.5 hours)
Today we went to a water park, so I had tons of time in the car and when I got home to work on the project.
