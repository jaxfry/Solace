# 30 June 2025 - Design Case (3 hours)
Today I designed two iterations of the case all while rembering how to use fusion, just a very early testing stage with some broken screen and stuff I've got laying around. I plan to redesign it to fit what ever display I end up choosing. On that note, I've got almost all of the components picked out except the display...
# 1 July 2025 - UI design (1 hour)
- Today I was limited on time, but I got the time and some nice gradients for the display.
